        According to the Pew Research Center in 2010, there were 50 Muslim-majority countries. Around 62% of the world's Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region (from Turkey to Indonesia), with over one billion adherents.
        The largest Muslim population in a country is in Indonesia, a country home to 12.7% of the world's Muslims, followed by Pakistan (11.1%), India (10.9%) and Bangladesh (9.2%).
        About 20% of Muslims live in the Arab world. In the Middle East, the non-Arab countries of Iran and Turkey are the largest Muslim-majority countries, while Egypt and Nigeria in Africa have the same status.
        The study found more Muslims in the United Kingdom than in Lebanon and more in China than in Syria. The Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has more Muslims than any other Muslim-majority countries except Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Iran and Turkey.

        Islamic clothing is clothing that is interpreted as being in accordance with the teachings of Islam. Muslims wear a wide variety of clothing, which is influenced not only by religious considerations, but also practical, cultural, social, and political factors. In modern times, some Muslims have adopted clothing based on Western traditions, while others wear modern forms of traditional Muslim dress, which over the centuries has typically included long, flowing garments. Besides its practical advantages in the climate of the Middle East, loose-fitting clothing is also generally regarded as conforming to Islamic teachings, which stipulate that body areas which are sexual in nature must be hidden from public view. Traditional dress for Muslim men has typically covered at least the head and the area between the waist and the knees, while traditional women's dress conceals the hair and the body from the ankles to the neck.
        Some Muslim women also cover their face. slamic dress is influenced by two scriptural sources, the Quran and hadith. The Quran provides guiding principles believed to have come from God, while the body of hadith describes a human role model through the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The branch of fashion industry influenced by Islamic principles is known as Islamic fashion.

      <h4 style="font-family: droid-sans;width: 140%;">
        The first pillar of Islam is called Shahadah or The Declaration of Faith. The shahada is the most basic expression of Islamic beliefs. It simply states that “There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet.” When a Muslim recites this they accept it as true and will follow all of the commitments of Islam. To become a Muslim, a person must recite this three times with complete sincerity in front of witnesses. 
      </h4>
      <h4 style="font-family: droid-sans;width: 140%;">
        The second pillar of Islam is Salat or Prayer. Muslims are expected to pray five times a day while facing Mecca. In Islamic countries there is a public call to prayer which sets the day. This ritual is over 1400 years old and practiced by millions of Muslims across the world. 
      </h4>
      <h4 style="font-family: droid-sans;width: 140%;">
        Zakat-charity or almsgiving is the third pillar of Islam. Muslims believe that they are meant to share their wealth with those less fortunate in their community of believers. Each year Muslims are expected to give 2.5% of their wages to charity. This giving is a form of worship and self-purification. This practice frees them from clinging to possessions and greed.
      </h4>
      <h4 style="font-family: droid-sans;width: 140%;">
        Fasting during the holy month of Ramadan is called Sawm and it is the fourth pillar of Islam. Ramadan occurs in the 9th month in the Islamic calendar. Ramadan lasts for 30 days. For the first 29 days Muslims are expected to fast giving up food or drink from dawn till dusk. They view Sawm as obedience to God and learn self-discipline to become spiritually stronger. 
      </h4>
      <h4 style="font-family: droid-sans;width: 140%;">
        The last of the five pillars of Islam is Hajj in which all Muslims, who are able, are required to make the pilgrimage, to Mecca and surrounding holy sites at least once in their lives. This ritual promotes the bonds of Islam and occurs once a year where every Muslim gathers together in Mecca to praise Allah before the Kaaba, a shrine in the great Mosque in Mecca. The Hajj occurs in the 12 month of the Islamic calendar.
